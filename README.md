# Hey there! 👋

I’m a Full Stack Developer with over 10 years of experience, and I’m truly passionate about creating projects that inspire and excite. I love exploring new technologies and getting hands-on with whatever sparks my curiosity. 🤓

## 🧑‍💻 Here’s a peek at what I’m currently working with:
- Go
- TypeScript
- Vue.js
- Generative AI (including Large Language Models and Image Generation)

## Hackero

My latest passion project is [hackero.io](https://hackero.io), a hacking simulation game with real-time gameplay. It’s got a desktop-style UI, a fully fleshed-out filesystem, missions, and so much more! I launched a classic version a while back, and now I’m working on an rewrite right now that will allow more game depth.

The game is powered by a custom-built backend framework that follows Domain-Driven Design principles and supports real-time connections. It’s been a rewarding journey, and I can’t wait to share it with the world.
